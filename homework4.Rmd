### Question 1
Load the data set mtcars in the datasets R package. Assume that the data set mtcars is a random sample. Compute the mean MPG, $\bar{x}$, of this sample.

You want to test whether the true MPG is $\mu_0$ or smaller using a one sided 5% level test. ($H_0:\mu=\mu_0$ versus $H_a:\mu<\mu_0$). Using that data set and a Z test:

Based on the mean MPG of the sample $\bar{x}$, and by using a Z test: what is the smallest value of $\mu_0$ that you would reject for (to two decimal places)?

__Answer__
```{r}
data(mtcars)
mu <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
s <- sd(mtcars$mpg)
n <-length(mtcars$mpg)
alpha <- 0.05
qt(1-alpha/2, n-1)
```
